## TRAVEL WEBSITE 
This is an SPA (Single Page Application) that has been built with certain objectives in mind. Some of the objectives include:

    1. The user should be able to view different images with the press of a button.

    2. There should be a sign up/in form within the SPA.

    3. The user should be able to move to sections of the page smoothly when the items on the navbar are clicked.


## LANGUAGES USED 
    
    1.HTML

    2.CSS

    3.JAVASCRIPT

## CHALLENGES FACED WHEN BUILDING THIS APP

- Since using an API for this project was a requirement, I went through a tedious process of finding the right API.


- This was the first time using a public API and after testing different APIs, I quickly realized that many of them(if not all) have access keys. 



- I tried using the APIs without the keys to no avail. Thats how I learned about Authorization headers though. So I wouldn't complain further.
